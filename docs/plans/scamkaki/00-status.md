# Status: Scamkaki

Updated: 2026-10-22 (Asia/Singapore).

- Gate 1 - Product: **APPROVED 2026-10-22** ([01-product.md](01-product.md), [mockups](mockups/)).
- Gate 2 - Architecture: **APPROVED 2026-10-22** ([02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md)).
- Gate 3 - Program Design: **APPROVED 2026-10-22** ([03-program-design.md](03-program-design.md)).
- Gate 4 - Slice plan: **APPROVED 2026-10-22** ([04-slices.md](04-slices.md)).

The user asked for compact versions of all four gates in one pass because of hackathon time (2026-10-22: "draft compact versions of all four in one pass as we dont have much time").
S1 authorized 2026-10-22 by the user ("You have my authorization to start slice 1"), with the installs ("I give authroizeation for 7") and a Bolna budget of $5 for today and tomorrow.
No other slice is authorized.

## Slices

- [x] S1 - Tracer: Guardian stub end to end, branch `scamkaki/slice-1-guardian-tracer`, done 2026-10-22; [evidence](evidence/s1-tracer.md). Deviation: tested by Bolna dashboard web call because the trial plan dials only +1/+91.
- [ ] S2 - Hokkien voice spike
- [ ] S3 - Guardian verdict and family transfer
- [ ] S4 - Ah Ma Bait with extraction and leak guard
- [ ] S5 - The loop: Guardian uses Bait's scripts
- [ ] S6 - Dashboard, report review and demo

## Notes for a fresh session

- Language: Python (user decision 2026-10-22).
- Stack: Bolna only as organiser tech; FastAPI on Render; Neon Postgres; Modal for Hokkien TTS. Structured script matching, no embeddings.
- Superseded: the Next.js and pgvector build plan in `PROGRESS.md` is replaced by these gate drafts.
- Git: `main` pushed to private `https://github.com/jaydonnnk/scamkaki` at `7e41056` on 2026-10-22; `outputs/` and `work/` are ignored as local research.

## Approval history

- 2026-10-22: Gates 1-4 approved together by the user ("Yea i approve all four gates.").
  Approval accepts the compact drafts as written, including the least confident decisions in Gate 3, as a proposal; it establishes no runtime, account or model evidence.
  It starts no slice and authorizes no install, provisioning, deployment, spending or phone call.
- 2026-10-22 amendment (user: "Im not using blueprint it costs money"): no `render.yaml`; the Render web service is created by hand in a per-project environment with variables entered manually. Removed `render.yaml` from Gate 3's file list; no behaviour, test or slice change, so no gate reopens.
- 2026-10-22 rename (user: "its wording only so leave the gate approved"): product renamed from Scam Ah Ma to Scamkaki; package `src/scamkaki/`, gate folder `docs/plans/scamkaki/`, branch prefix `scamkaki/`. Persona names Ah Ma Bait and Ah Ma Guardian unchanged. Wording only; no gate reopens.
- 2026-10-22 amendment (user: "Add the Talk to Guardian button to our dashboard"): new route `POST /web-call/session` mints a Bolna Web Call SDK session for the Guardian agent, and the dashboard gets a Talk to Guardian button. Reason: the trial plan dials only +1/+91. Known risk: the dashboard has no auth, so anyone with the URL can start calls on the wallet. Added test `test_web_call_session_mints_for_guardian_agent`. No gate reopens.
- 2026-10-22 amendment (user: "add a simple authentication system. So that only me(admin) can access scamkaki"): HTTP Basic sign-in (`ADMIN_USERNAME`, default `admin`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) guards `/` and `/web-call/session`; locked when no password is set. Webhook, tool and `/healthz` keep their own checks. Four tests added; each guard mutated alone fails a test. No gate reopens.
